Welcome to the 'My Bog App'. You can use it to create and maintain your favorite creatures like:
* creature name
* description
* an image for each creature

## Technologies Used
* bootstrap for styling the HTML page
* Ruby on Rails
* Active Records for PostgreSQL DB

## The personal experience on this project:
* The required CRUD functionality took me about 5 hours on the first run and 66 minutes on my last run(5th). I invested a LOT of times trying to understand as much details as I can on the first run. I think I got most of the concept.
* After that I spent many hours styling up the page, adding the edit button, the "back to the front page" button. And had some fun seeding up a few creatures.
